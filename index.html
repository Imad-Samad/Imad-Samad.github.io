      <h3>Imad Samad</h3>
      <p> 
 	    I have just successfully completed my Mathematics, Computer Science and Economics A-Levels at 
 	    Graveney School in South London. I have had a litle bit of programming experience during my 
      Computer Science A-Level, however due to covid, the programming coursework was cancelled, it's 
      also my first time programming in Java. I play a plathora of sports from football to tennis and I am 
      interested in persuring a career in data science, software engineernig or artificial integlligence.  </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: 3D Spiral</h3>
    <p>
	  My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	  City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates an understanding of 3D shapes
	  aswell as the rotate(), translate() and scale() methods. It also shows a comprehensive
	  understanding of if statements to allow user interaction. I created a 3D object 
	  spiralling towards the middle of itself then expanding outwards creatng a whirlpool 
	  effect. It also uses noise() to mimic the movement of a small insect, which is more 
    effective than random() as it gives the object a more organic and natural feel. I've also 
    included some user interaction to change the colour of the object and also the size. 
    The user can press 'r','b','g' or 'p' to change the objects colour to red, blue, green 
    or purple. Also the user can press 'l' or 's' on the keyboard to increase or reduce the 
    size of the object. Finaly the user can press the space bar to pause the movement of the spiral.

    <h3> 1007 Programming in Java: Final Project </h3>
    <p>
	  My second programming project, concluding the "IN1007 Programming in Java" module at 
  	City (2021). This Java project demonstrates an understanding of the Object Oriented 
    Programming (OOP) concepts taught in the module. My game is inspired by the Donkey 
    Kong arcade game where the main character, in my case Roo, has to work it's way up 
    to collect its objective, in my case, Joey. The game contains game music which runs 
    on a loop in the background, aswell as sounds upon collision with Joey or a bomb. 
    The Roo is controlled through the keyboard and there is also a GUI containing 
    buttons on the top of the game to quit, pause, resume, save and load. The player has 
    to collect Joey while dodging as many bombs as possible, if the player collides with 
    more than 3 bombs in a level, GAME OVER. The life-count resets when moving to a new 
    level. The game also contains advanced save/load to retain the state of the dynamic 
    objects in a level completely.
